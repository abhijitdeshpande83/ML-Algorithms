Files were made in JupyterLab. They can be run in any environment that supports .ipynb files.The .csv files are in the zip. In Q2 they need to read by inputting their file locations into the pd.read_csv('location/mnist_train.csv') and pd.read_csv('location/ 2014_Financial_Data.csv’) lines of code respectively for data.
